      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>SkillBridge NG exists to close the gap between skilled artisans and technical institutions in Nigeria. We connect experienced craftsmen and women with schools that need practical, hands-on trainers ‚Äî ensuring students receive real-world skills from real experts.</p>
      <p>Our goal is simple: <strong>Elevate technical education by empowering those who build, craft, and teach with their hands.</strong></p>

      <h2>Founded By: Amarachi Nwachukwu</h2>
      <p>I am a certified teacher (TRCN), educator, and skills development advocate with a strong belief in the power of vocational training to transform lives.</p>

      <p>I hold a <strong>Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) in Curriculum and Teaching</strong> from the University of Calabar (Second Class Upper), where I developed a deep understanding of modern pedagogy and learner-centered instruction. I‚Äôm also a holder of a <strong>National Diploma in Banking and Finance</strong> from Osun State Polytechnic, giving me a unique blend of educational insight and financial awareness.</p>

      <p>In 2024, I became a <strong>TRCN-Certified Teacher</strong> ‚Äî not just to validate my academic journey, but to commit myself to improving learning outcomes in Nigeria. Through my work and research, I noticed a critical problem: many TVET schools lack qualified practical instructors, while thousands of master artisans remain unrecognized and underutilized.</p>

      <p>That‚Äôs why I created <strong>SkillBridge NG</strong>. This platform is my response ‚Äî a bridge between skill mastery and structured education. It‚Äôs built on the belief that every welder, tailor, electrician, and mechanic has something valuable to teach, and every student deserves access to that knowledge.</p>

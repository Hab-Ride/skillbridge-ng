      <h2>Our Mission: Where Skills Meet Opportunity</h2>
      <p>In Nigeria, thousands of skilled artisans work every day — building homes, designing clothes, fixing machines — yet their knowledge rarely reaches classrooms.</p>
      <p>At the same time, technical schools struggle to find qualified hands-on trainers, leaving students with theory but no practice.</p>
      <p><strong>SkillBridge NG exists to close this gap.</strong></p>
      <p>We connect experienced craftsmen and women with schools that need real-world training. Because education shouldn’t happen in isolation — it should be shaped by those who do the work.</p>

      <p>I am a TRCN-certified teacher, educator, and believer in the power of practical skills to change lives.</p>

      <p>I hold a <strong>Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) in Curriculum and Teaching</strong> from the University of Calabar, where I studied how students learn best — not just in textbooks, but through experience. I also earned a <strong>National Diploma in Banking and Finance</strong> from Osun State Polytechnic, giving me a unique blend of educational insight and financial pragmatism.</p>

      <p>In 2024, I became a certified teacher — not just to complete a qualification, but to commit myself to transforming how Nigeria sees technical education.</p>

      <p>I saw a painful disconnect: schools begging for skilled instructors… and master artisans sitting nearby, unrecognized, underused, and unheard.</p>

      <p>So I created <strong>SkillBridge NG</strong> — a platform built on one belief:</p>
      <p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; color:#0057b7;">“Every artisan is a teacher. Every student deserves a mentor.”</p>

      <p>This isn’t just a website. It’s my promise to elevate the dignity of labor — one trained student, one empowered artisan, one school at a time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="values">
      <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>🛠️ Dignity of Labor:</strong> No skill is small when it builds a nation.</li>
        <li><strong>🎓 Real-World Learning:</strong> Training that prepares students for actual jobs.</li>
        <li><strong>🤝 Trusted Connections:</strong> Verified artisans. Reliable placements. Clear communication.</li>
        <li><strong>✅ Integrity:</strong> Honest partnerships between schools, artisans, and communities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Expanding Horizons: Learning Beyond the Classroom</h2>
      <p>At SkillBridge NG, we believe that real skill isn’t just taught — it’s experienced.</p>

      <p>That’s why we go beyond matching artisans with schools. We organize guided exposure trips to places like <strong>Computer Village (Alaba International)</strong> — Nigeria’s bustling hub of innovation, repair, and digital enterprise.</p>

      <p>Imagine a student who learns phone repair theory in class, then walks into Computer Village and sees dozens of master technicians diagnosing faults, replacing parts, and coding firmware — all in real time. That moment changes everything.</p>

      <p>We arrange periodic field visits where students can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Observe live repairs and troubleshooting sessions</li>
        <li>Interact with certified technicians and entrepreneurs</li>
        <li>Learn about sourcing tools, pricing services, and customer care</li>
        <li>Get hands-on practice under expert supervision</li>
        <li>Explore career paths in hardware, software, and digital business</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For our coding learners, we integrate these experiences too — showing how software powers devices, apps, and businesses thriving in Nigeria’s informal tech economy.</p>

      <p>This exposure doesn’t replace classroom learning — it completes it. It turns fear into curiosity, doubt into confidence, and dreams into plans.</p>

      <p>Because when a young person sees someone who looks like them building something powerful… they start believing: <em>“I can do that too.”</em></p>

      <h2>Our Mission: Where Skills Meet Opportunity</h2>
      <p>In Nigeria, thousands of skilled artisans work every day — building homes, designing clothes, fixing machines — yet their knowledge rarely reaches classrooms.</p>
      <p>At the same time, technical schools struggle to find qualified hands-on trainers, leaving students with theory but no practice.</p>
      <p><strong>SkillBridge NG exists to close this gap.</strong></p>
      <p>We connect experienced craftsmen and women with schools that need real-world training. Because education shouldn’t happen in isolation — it should be shaped by those who do the work.</p>

      <p>I am a TRCN-certified teacher, educator, and believer in the power of practical skills to change lives.</p>

      <p>I hold a <strong>Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) in Curriculum and Teaching</strong> from the University of Calabar, where I studied how students learn best — not just in textbooks, but through experience. I also earned a <strong>National Diploma in Banking and Finance</strong> from Osun State Polytechnic, giving me a unique blend of educational insight and financial pragmatism.</p>

      <p>In 2024, I became a certified teacher — not just to complete a qualification, but to commit myself to transforming how Nigeria sees technical education.</p>

      <p>I saw a painful disconnect: schools begging for skilled instructors… and master artisans sitting nearby, unrecognized, underused, and unheard.</p>

      <p>So I created <strong>SkillBridge NG</strong> — a platform built on one belief:</p>
      <p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; color:#0057b7;">“Every artisan is a teacher. Every student deserves a mentor.”</p>

      <p>This isn’t just a website. It’s my promise to elevate the dignity of labor — one trained student, one empowered artisan, one school at a time.</p>
